bracer
======

Bracer is a rewriting system for curly-brace languages: C, Go, Java, Javascript.
It is intended to be simple, powerful, and easy to extend, making tradeoffs for flexibility rather than strict language compliance.
It is in very early alpha; only the C backend works right now.
Pull requests are enthusiastically accepted.
